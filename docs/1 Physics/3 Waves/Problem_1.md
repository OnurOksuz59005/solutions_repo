# Interference Patterns on a Water Surface

## Motivation

Interference occurs when waves from different sources overlap, creating new patterns. On a water surface, this can be easily observed when ripples from different points meet, forming distinctive interference patterns. These patterns can show us how waves combine in different ways, either reinforcing each other or canceling out.

Studying these patterns helps us understand wave behavior in a simple, visual way. It also allows us to explore important concepts, like the relationship between wave phase and the effects of multiple sources. This task offers a hands-on approach to learning about wave interactions and their real-world applications, making it an interesting and engaging way to dive into wave physics.

## Theoretical Background

A circular wave on the water surface, emanating from a point source located at $(x_0, y_0)$, can be described by the Single Disturbance equation:

$$\eta(x, y, t) = \frac{A}{\sqrt{r}} \cdot \cos(kr - \omega t + \phi)$$

where:

- $\eta(x, y, t)$ is the displacement of the water surface at point $(x, y)$ and time $t$,
- $A$ is the amplitude of the wave,
- $k = \frac{2\pi}{\lambda}$ is the wave number, related to the wavelength $\lambda$,
- $\omega = 2\pi f$ is the angular frequency, related to the frequency $f$,
- $r = \sqrt{(x - x_0)^2 + (y - y_0)^2}$ is the distance from the source to the point $(x, y)$,
- $\phi$ is the initial phase.

### Principle of Superposition

When multiple waves overlap at a point, the resulting displacement is the sum of the individual displacements. For $N$ sources, the total displacement is given by:

$$\eta_{sum}(x, y, t) = \sum_{i=1}^{N} \eta_i(x, y, t)$$

where $N$ is the number of sources (vertices of the polygon).

### Constructive and Destructive Interference

- **Constructive interference** occurs when waves combine to create a larger amplitude. This happens when the waves are in phase.
- **Destructive interference** occurs when waves combine to create a smaller amplitude or cancel out completely. This happens when the waves are out of phase.

## Analysis of Interference Patterns for Regular Polygons

In this study, we analyze the interference patterns formed by waves emitted from sources placed at the vertices of regular polygons. We consider four different configurations: triangle, square, pentagon, and hexagon.

The computational model simulates the interference patterns formed by waves emitted from sources placed at the vertices of regular polygons. It calculates the displacement at each point on the water surface by summing the contributions from all sources, following the principle of superposition. The model visualizes the interference patterns using 2D color maps, 3D surface plots, and animations to show the time evolution of the patterns.

By varying the number of vertices in the polygon, we can observe how the complexity and symmetry of the interference pattern change. This provides insights into how waves combine and interact in different geometric configurations, demonstrating fundamental principles of wave physics.

### Triangle (3 Vertices)

For a triangle, three wave sources are placed at the vertices of an equilateral triangle. The interference pattern shows:

- A central region of constructive interference where waves from all three sources arrive approximately in phase.
- Three primary axes of constructive interference extending outward from the center along the angle bisectors of the triangle.
- Regions of destructive interference between these axes.

## Observations and Conclusions

1. **Symmetry**: The interference pattern reflects the symmetry of the polygon. A regular polygon with $n$ sides produces an interference pattern with $n$-fold rotational symmetry.

2. **Central Constructive Interference**: All configurations show a region of constructive interference at the center of the polygon, where waves from all sources can arrive approximately in phase.

3. **Radial Pattern**: The interference patterns exhibit radial structures with alternating bands of constructive and destructive interference.

4. **Complexity with Increasing Vertices**: As the number of vertices increases, the interference pattern becomes more complex and intricate, with more regions of constructive and destructive interference.

5. **Distance Effect**: The amplitude of the waves decreases with distance from the sources (as $1/\sqrt{r}$), leading to less pronounced interference effects far from the sources.

## Applications

Understanding interference patterns has numerous applications:

1. **Acoustic Design**: Designing concert halls and auditoriums to optimize sound distribution.

2. **Antenna Arrays**: Designing antenna arrays to focus electromagnetic waves in specific directions.

3. **Optical Instruments**: Understanding and utilizing interference in microscopes, telescopes, and other optical instruments.

4. **Water Wave Energy Harvesting**: Optimizing the placement of wave energy converters to maximize energy extraction.

5. **Educational Demonstrations**: Providing visual demonstrations of wave principles for educational purposes.
