# Equivalent Resistance Using Graph Theory

## Motivation

Calculating equivalent resistance is a fundamental problem in electrical circuits, essential for understanding and designing efficient systems. While traditional methods involve iteratively applying series and parallel resistor rules, these approaches can become cumbersome for complex circuits with many components. Graph theory offers a powerful alternative, providing a structured and algorithmic way to analyze circuits.

By representing a circuit as a graph—where nodes correspond to junctions and edges represent resistors with weights equal to their resistance values—we can systematically simplify even the most intricate networks. This method not only streamlines calculations but also opens the door to automated analysis, making it particularly useful in modern applications like circuit simulation software, optimization problems, and network design.

Studying equivalent resistance through graph theory is valuable not only for its practical applications but also for the deeper insights it provides into the interplay between electrical and mathematical concepts. This approach highlights the versatility of graph theory, demonstrating its relevance across physics, engineering, and computer science.

## Theoretical Background

### Graph Theory Approach to Circuit Analysis

Electrical circuits can be represented as graphs, where:

- Nodes represent junctions or connection points
- Edges represent circuit elements (resistors, batteries, etc.)

![Circuit to Graph Transformation](./images/graph_representation.png)

This graph representation allows us to apply graph theory algorithms to analyze the circuit and calculate the equivalent resistance between any two nodes.

### Graph Representation of Circuits

In the graph theory approach to circuit analysis:

- **Nodes** (vertices) represent junctions or connection points in the circuit
- **Edges** represent resistors, with edge weights corresponding to resistance values
- The **source** and **target** nodes represent the terminals across which we want to calculate the equivalent resistance

### Reduction Rules

The algorithm for calculating equivalent resistance relies on two fundamental circuit reduction rules:

1. **Series Reduction**: When two resistors $R_1$ and $R_2$ are connected in series, they can be replaced by a single equivalent resistor $R_{eq} = R_1 + R_2$.

2. **Parallel Reduction**: When two resistors $R_1$ and $R_2$ are connected in parallel, they can be replaced by a single equivalent resistor $R_{eq} = \frac{R_1 \cdot R_2}{R_1 + R_2}$ or equivalently $\frac{1}{R_{eq}} = \frac{1}{R_1} + \frac{1}{R_2}$.

In graph terms:

- **Series Reduction**: A node with exactly two connections can be eliminated, and its adjacent edges combined into a single edge with resistance equal to the sum of the original resistances.

- **Parallel Reduction**: Multiple edges between the same pair of nodes can be combined into a single edge with resistance calculated using the parallel resistor formula.

#### Series Reduction

When resistors are connected in series (one after another with no branches), they can be replaced by a single equivalent resistor whose resistance is the sum of the individual resistances.

![Series Reduction](./images/series_reduction.png)

**Series Reduction Formula:**

$R_{eq} = R_1 + R_2 + ... + R_n$

**Example Calculation:**

$R_{eq} = R_1 + R_2 = 10k\Omega + 20k\Omega = 30k\Omega$

#### Parallel Reduction

When resistors are connected in parallel (providing multiple paths between the same two nodes), they can be replaced by a single equivalent resistor whose conductance (1/R) is the sum of the individual conductances.

![Parallel Reduction](./images/parallel_reduction.png)

**Parallel Reduction Formulas:**

$\frac{1}{R_{eq}} = \frac{1}{R_1} + \frac{1}{R_2} + ... + \frac{1}{R_n}$

Alternatively:

$R_{eq} = \frac{R_1 \cdot R_2}{R_1 + R_2}$ (for two resistors)

**Example Calculation:**

$\frac{1}{R_{eq}} = \frac{1}{30k\Omega} + \frac{1}{60k\Omega} = \frac{2}{60k\Omega} + \frac{1}{60k\Omega} = \frac{3}{60k\Omega} = \frac{1}{20k\Omega}$

Therefore, $R_{eq} = 20k\Omega$

Or using the product/sum formula:

$R_{eq} = \frac{30k\Omega \cdot 60k\Omega}{30k\Omega + 60k\Omega} = \frac{1800k\Omega^2}{90k\Omega} = 20k\Omega$

#### Delta-Wye (Δ-Y) Transformation

For more complex circuits that cannot be simplified using only series and parallel reductions, the Delta-Wye transformation can be used to convert between these two equivalent configurations.

![Delta-Wye Transformation](./images/delta_wye_transformation.png)

**Delta to Wye Transformation Formulas:**

$R_a = \frac{R_{ab} \cdot R_{ca}}{R_{ab} + R_{bc} + R_{ca}}$

$R_b = \frac{R_{ab} \cdot R_{bc}}{R_{ab} + R_{bc} + R_{ca}}$

$R_c = \frac{R_{bc} \cdot R_{ca}}{R_{ab} + R_{bc} + R_{ca}}$

**Example Calculation:**

$R_a = \frac{10\Omega \cdot 30\Omega}{10\Omega + 20\Omega + 30\Omega} = \frac{300\Omega}{60\Omega} = 5\Omega$

$R_b = \frac{10\Omega \cdot 20\Omega}{10\Omega + 20\Omega + 30\Omega} = \frac{200\Omega}{60\Omega} = 3.33\Omega$

$R_c = \frac{20\Omega \cdot 30\Omega}{10\Omega + 20\Omega + 30\Omega} = \frac{600\Omega}{60\Omega} = 10\Omega$

</details>

The computational model represents electrical circuits as graphs and implements algorithms to systematically reduce these graphs to calculate equivalent resistance. The implementation visualizes each step of the reduction process, providing insights into how the algorithm works and how circuit simplification progresses.

### Example Circuits

The implementation was tested on several example circuits:

#### Example 1: Simple Series Circuit

A simple series circuit with three resistors (10kΩ, 20kΩ, and 30kΩ) connected in series.

![Simple Series Circuit](./images/example_1_circuit.png)

**Calculation:**
$R_{eq} = R_1 + R_2 + R_3 = 10k\Omega + 20k\Omega + 30k\Omega = 60k\Omega$

The algorithm correctly calculates the equivalent resistance as 60kΩ.

#### Example 2: Simple Parallel Circuit

A simple parallel circuit with two resistors (10kΩ and 20kΩ) connected in parallel.

![Simple Parallel Circuit](./images/example_2_circuit.png)

**Calculation:**
$\frac{1}{R_{eq}} = \frac{1}{R_1} + \frac{1}{R_2} = \frac{1}{10k\Omega} + \frac{1}{20k\Omega} = \frac{2}{20k\Omega} + \frac{1}{20k\Omega} = \frac{3}{20k\Omega}$

$R_{eq} = \frac{20k\Omega}{3} \approx 6.67k\Omega$

The algorithm correctly calculates the equivalent resistance as 6.67kΩ.

#### Example 3: Mixed Series-Parallel Circuit

A more complex circuit with a combination of series and parallel connections.

![Mixed Series-Parallel Circuit](./images/example_3_circuit.png)

The algorithm reduces this circuit step by step, first identifying series connections and then parallel connections, until the equivalent resistance is calculated.

#### Example 4: Wheatstone Bridge Circuit

A Wheatstone bridge circuit, which is a more complex configuration that includes a bridge resistor.

![Wheatstone Bridge Circuit](./images/example_4_circuit.png)

This circuit requires multiple reduction steps, including both series and parallel reductions.

## Analysis and Efficiency

### Algorithm Efficiency

The time complexity of the algorithm depends on the number of nodes and edges in the circuit graph:

- Identifying series nodes: O(n), where n is the number of nodes
- Identifying parallel edges: O(e), where e is the number of edges
- Each reduction step: O(1)
- Overall algorithm: O(n² + e²) in the worst case, as each reduction removes at least one node or edge

### Limitations and Potential Improvements

1. **Complex Circuits**: The current implementation may not handle all complex circuits, especially those requiring delta-wye transformations. Adding support for these transformations would make the algorithm more robust.

2. **Optimization**: The algorithm could be optimized by prioritizing certain types of reductions or using more efficient data structures.

3. **Generalization**: The approach could be extended to handle other circuit elements like capacitors and inductors, or to calculate other circuit properties like impedance in AC circuits.

4. **Parallelization**: For very large circuits, parallel processing could be used to speed up the reduction process.

## Conclusion

Graph theory provides a powerful and elegant approach to calculating equivalent resistance in electrical circuits. By representing circuits as graphs and applying systematic reduction rules, we can handle complex configurations that would be difficult to analyze using traditional methods.

The algorithm presented here demonstrates the effectiveness of this approach for a variety of circuit configurations, from simple series and parallel combinations to more complex mixed circuits. While there are limitations for extremely complex circuits, the graph-theoretic approach offers a solid foundation that can be extended with additional techniques like delta-wye transformations.

This application of graph theory to electrical circuit analysis highlights the interdisciplinary nature of the field and its practical relevance in engineering and physics. The systematic approach not only simplifies calculations but also provides deeper insights into the structure and behavior of electrical networks.
